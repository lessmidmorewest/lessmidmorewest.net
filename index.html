    <p>Clint Budley & Roger White believe so. People making country music today have never detasseled corn let alone scooped hog shit, ok? They're frauds. Country music has been mid at best for far too long. For God's sake even Post Malone & Beyonce is making this crap! One day some Nashville corporate executive woke up n decided to suck the entire soul out of the genre. Reminds me of my first ex wife!! Enough is enough. We're just a couple country boys, working hard making a livin out in the plains. We make music for Midwesterners that other people will probably like too. If you don't like our music keep it to yourself BUDDY!!!</p></div>

    <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#aaa;"><p>Clint Budley</p>
    <p>is a 36 year old man who spent his 20s touring in a Honky-Tonk traveling troupe named Wonky-Honk, which saw limited success in 1990's in rural Illinois. He saw billboard success on his hit single 'WALK THE HONK' which debuted at 97 on the billboard top 100. All of his work has been removed from the internet after a disagreement over a "vaccination card" while attempting to patronize a strip club in Iowa City. Clint joined forces with Roger in 2018 after Will Travis died of a panic attack during a show, which caused him to walk in front of a bus in Chicago, IL.</p>
    <p>When Clint isn't producing, performing, and singing original music he enjoys drinking beer in the same chair every night, and cheering on the Chicago Bears even though he refuses to go back to Chicago after what happened to his best friend when he got hit by that bus. He often avoids spending time with his wife Nancy and their four children Bill, Bayleigh, Brayley, and Brent.</p> </div>

    <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#ccc;"><p>Roger White</p>
    <p>is a 43 year old man who spent his 20s, and some of his 30s, behind the wheel of an 18-Wheeler driving mostly pepsi across the midwest. Roger is not classically trained in any instrument whatsoever but claims to be the heart and spirit of the LESS MiD<small>more</small>WEST Project. </p>
    <p>When he isn't behind the wheel of his beloved Truck you can find him boot scootin at the nearest Honky-Tonk. He has been married to his wife Suzanne for 20 wonderful years despite never having any children. Roger has not been on speaking terms with his cousin Ron White since being left out of the Blue Collar comedy Tour in 2004. If asked Ron will act like he doesn't even know me it's bullshit!</p> </div>
