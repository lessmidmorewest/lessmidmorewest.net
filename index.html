    <p>Clint Budley & Roger White believe so. People making country music today have never detasseled corn let alone scooped hog shit, ok? They're frauds. Country music has been mid at best for far too long. For God's sake even Post Malone & Beyonce is making this shit. One day some Nashville corporate executive woke up n decided to suck the entire soul out of the genre. Reminds me of my first ex wife!! Enough is enough. We're from the Midwest where good people have been working hard making a livin out of the plains. We make music for Midwesterners that other people will probably like too. If you don't like our music keep it to yourself!!!</p></div>

He saw billboard success on his hit single 'WALK THE HONK' which debuted at 97 on the billboard top 100. Clint joined forces with Roger in 2018 after Will Travis died of a panic attack during a show, which caused him to walk in front of a bus in Chicago, IL.</p>

    <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#ccc;"><p>Roger White</p>
    <p>is a 45 year old man who spent his 20s, and some of his 30s, behind the wheel of an 18-Wheeler driving mostly pepsi across the midwest. During this period, is where most of the inspiration behind his lyrics is derived from. Roger is not classically trained in any instrument whatsoever but claims to be the heart and spirit of the LESS MiD<small>more</small>WEST Project. Roger scored a Nashville record deal in 2019 due to his claimed relation to his great great uncle Tex Williams widely known for his hit single 'Smoke!, Smoke!, Smoke! (that cigarette)' </p>
    <p>When he isn't behind the wheel of his beloved Truck you can find him boot scootin at the nearest Honky-Tonk. He has been married to his wife Suzanne for 20 wonderful years despite never having any children.</p> </div>
