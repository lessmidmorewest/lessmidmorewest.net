    <p>Clint Budley & Roger White believe so. People making country music today have never walked beans let alone scooped hog shit, ok? They're frauds. Country music has been mid at best for far too long. We guess one day some Nashville corporation decided to suck the entire soul out of the genre. Well enough is enough. We're from the Midwest where good people have been making folk, blues, and midwest emo music for a long time. We make music for Midwesterners that other people will probably like too. If you don't like our music keep it to yourself!</p></div>

  <p>is a 42 year old man who spent his 20s touring in a Honky-Tonk traveling troupe named Wonky-Honk, which saw limited success in 1990's in rural Illinois. He saw billboard success on his hit single 'WALK THE HONK' which debuted at 97 on the billboard top 100. Clint joined forces with Roger in 2018 after Will Travis died of a panic attack during a show, which caused him to walk in front of a bus in Chicago, IL.</p>
  <p>When Clint isn't producing, performing, and singing original music he spends time with his wife Nancy and their four children Buck, Bill, Bayleigh, and Brent.</p> </div>

  <div class="column side" style="background-color:#ccc;"><p>Roger White</p>
  <p>is a 45 year old man who spent his 20s, and some of his 30s, behind the wheel of an 18-Wheeler driving pepsi across the midwest. During those times, is where most of the inspiration behind his lyrics is derived from. Roger is not classically trained in any instrument whatsoever but claims to be the heart and spirit of the LESS MiD<small>more</small>WEST Project. Roger scored a Nashville record deal in 2019 due to his claimed relation to his great great uncle Tex Williams widely known for his hit single 'Smoke!, Smoke!, Smoke! (that cigarette)' </p>
  <p>When he isn't drinking & driving you can find him boot scootin at the nearest Honky-Tonk. He has been married to his wife Suzanne for 20 wonderful years despite never having any children.</p> </div>
